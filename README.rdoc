== Front-end Programming Challenge

Instructions:
  Fork on github 
  Commit early, commit often
  Issue a pull request when your done.
Tasks
  (1)  Create a Single Page app where the user can compose a message (max 140 chars), and 		add recipients (sms and/or email).
  (2)  The input for recipient info should allow for name, email and/or sms.  
  (3)  As recipients are added on the front-end, the info must be validated and sent to the 		server using the API request: /programming_challenge/add
  (4)  To enhance usability, during the creation of recipients, create an autocomplete input box 		where the user can choose from previously uploaded recipients.  Use API request  /programming_challenge/autocomplete
  (5) Have a final submit button to send the message to all recipients using API request: /programming_challenge/send
  (6) Implement all API requests in PageService.js 
  (7) Do basic styling of the buttons using CSS classes. Define these classes in 				application_page.css.scss and use variables defined in mixins.css.scss
  

Requirements:
  - Use AngularJS framework
  - Usable in Mobile Devices (Responsive)
